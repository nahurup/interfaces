            <p class="lead">This is a great place to talk about your webpage. This template is purposefully unstyled so you can use it as a boilerplate or starting point for you own landing page designs! This template features:</p>
            <div class="entry-content clearfix">
              <div class="ttr_start"></div><p><a href="https://halloweendailynews.com/tag/scooby-doo/">Scooby-Doo</a> and the Mystery Inc. gang are back in the all-new animated feature film <a href="https://halloweendailynews.com/tag/happy-halloween-scooby-doo/"><em>Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo!</em></a>, and they’re teaming up with Elvira to face DC’s classic Batman villain Scarecrow, coming this October from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.</p>
       <p>It’s being marketed as the first ever feature length Scooby-Doo Halloween movie, but that’s not exactly correct. There was already the 71-minute <em>Scooby-Doo and the Goblin King</em> animated feature, which was released in 2008 and also takes place on Halloween. Then there was the 2013 short <em>Scooby-Doo and the Spooky Scarecrow</em>, which was followed in 2015 by another animated feature, <em>Scooby-Doo and Kiss: A Rock and Roll Mystery</em>, both of which also took place on Halloween. And that wasn’t even the first time that the members of Kiss, voicing themselves, joined the Mystery Inc. gang for the holiday, as there was originally the sixth episode of the&nbsp;second season&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>What’s New, Scooby-Doo?</em>, which was called “A Scooby-Doo Halloween” and aired in 2003 also guest-starring the rock legends.</p>
       <p>So Scooby is certainly no stranger to Halloween adventures, but now the Mystery Inc. gang are back in the all-new animated feature film&nbsp;<em>Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo!</em>, and they’re teaming up with the Mistress of the Dark herself, horror icon Elvira (aka Cassandra Peterson), as herself, to face one of DC comics’ classic Batman villains. And this isn’t the first time Elvira has worked with the gang either, as she also appeared as herself in the 2019 animated feature sequel <em>Return to Zombie Island</em>.</p>
       <p>In addition to Elvira, the film also stars Bill Nye the Science Guy as himself, along with the great Frank Welker once again voicing Scooby and Fred, as well as Grey Griffin as Daphne, Kate Micucci as Velma, and <a href="https://halloweendailynews.com/tag/scream/"><em>Scream</em></a> star Matthew Lillard reprising his role from the first two live action <em>Scooby-Doo</em> movies as Shaggy.</p>
       <p>According to the official synopsis, when toxic ooze brings the Crystal Cove pumpkin patch to life, it’s up to Scooby, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma, and Fred to save the day. In investigating who’s behind these high-flying jack-o-lanterns and their king-sized pumpkin leader, the gang teams up with Elvira and soon comes face to face with Doctor Jonathan Crane, also known as the Scarecrow, a recent escapee from Arkham Asylum.</p>
       <p>Crane is voiced by Dwight Schultz. Whether or not Batman himself will make an appearance is unknown at this time.</p>
       <p><em>Happy Halloween</em> was written, produced, and directed by Maxwell Atoms, creator of Cartoon Network’s&nbsp;<em>Evil Con Carne</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</em>. Sam Register (of <em>Ben 10,&nbsp;Batman: The Killing Joke</em>, and the upcoming<em>&nbsp;Gremlins:&nbsp;Secrets of the Mogwai</em>) serves as executive producer.</p>
       <p>We are excited to report that <em>Happy Halloween, Scooby-Doo!</em> will be released on <a href="https://amzn.to/3jrwYqm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2YHnLSC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DVD</a> on October 6, 2020.</p>
